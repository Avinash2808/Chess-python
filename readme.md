This is an in-development chess game written in python and finally it would contain multiplayer support(global) as well as hopefully AI(not random).
Initially, I was worried and possessive about my code, having worked hard while writing it. But then I thought, hey, its my first project, and the more I share and open up to the world, the more I'll GROW..:)
So go ahead, go through the code. And if you find anything weird, PLEASE let me know. I want to know how to make my code better.
And if you like something. By all means, take it, just drop me a note and let me know what you liked about it @ ssatija95@gmail.com
