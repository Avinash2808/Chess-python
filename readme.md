This is a major upheavel of the background processing required for the chess program, making the code cleaner and program more efficient, while helping me maitain my sanity. This does not inculde the console

#initial
This is an in-development chess game written in python and finally it would contain multiplayer support(global) as well as hopefully AI(not random).
Initially, I was worried and possessive about my code, having worked hard while writing it. But then I thought, hey, its my first project, and the more I share and open up to the world, the more I'll GROW..:)
So go ahead, go through the code. And if you find anything weird, PLEASE let me know. I want to know how to make my code better.
And if you like something. By all means, take it, just drop me a note and let me know what you liked about it @ ssatija95@gmail.com
